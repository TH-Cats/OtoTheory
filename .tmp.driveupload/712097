# What Are Intervals?

**Intervals are the distances between notes.** They're the foundation of everything in music—melodies, chords, and scales all depend on intervals.

## Why Intervals Matter

### **For Melodies**
- Intervals create the shape and character of your melodies
- Small intervals (steps) feel smooth and connected
- Large intervals (leaps) create excitement and drama

### **For Chords**
- Chords are built by stacking intervals
- Different interval combinations create different chord qualities
- Understanding intervals helps you build any chord

### **For Scales**
- Scales are sequences of intervals
- Each scale has its own unique interval pattern
- Knowing intervals helps you understand why scales sound different

## The Building Blocks

### **Perfect Intervals**
- **Unison (1st):** Same note
- **Octave (8th):** Same note, different register
- **Perfect 4th:** Strong, stable sound
- **Perfect 5th:** Very stable, used in power chords

### **Major/Minor Intervals**
- **Major 2nd:** Whole step up
- **Minor 2nd:** Half step up (semitone)
- **Major 3rd:** Two whole steps
- **Minor 3rd:** One and a half steps

### **Special Intervals**
- **Tritone (Augmented 4th):** The "devil's interval"—tense and unstable
- **Major 7th:** Close to octave, creates tension
- **Minor 7th:** Bluesy, relaxed sound

## How to Practice

### **Start Simple**
1. **Play two notes** and listen to the sound
2. **Identify the interval** by ear
3. **Check with the app** to see if you're right

### **Use Familiar Songs**
- **"Happy Birthday"** starts with a major 2nd
- **"Somewhere Over the Rainbow"** uses many different intervals
- **"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"** is perfect for practicing

### **Build Gradually**
- Start with **perfect intervals** (unison, octave, 4th, 5th)
- Add **major and minor 3rds**
- Practice **2nds and 7ths** last

## In Your Playing

### **Melody Writing**
- Use **steps** for smooth, flowing melodies
- Use **leaps** for dramatic moments
- **Mix both** for interesting, varied melodies

### **Chord Construction**
- **Major chords:** Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th
- **Minor chords:** Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th
- **7th chords:** Add a 7th interval to any triad

### **Scale Understanding**
- **Major scale:** W-W-H-W-W-W-H (whole and half steps)
- **Minor scale:** W-H-W-W-H-W-W
- **Pentatonic:** Skip certain intervals for a simpler sound

## Summary

Intervals are the DNA of music. Once you understand them, you can:
- **Build any chord** you want
- **Create melodies** that sound intentional
- **Understand scales** and how they work
- **Communicate** with other musicians

**Start with the basics, practice regularly, and let your ears guide you.**
