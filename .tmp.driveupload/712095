# What is Music Theory?

**Music theory is like a recipe for pasta.** Just as a recipe turns your cooking intuition into something anyone can recreate, music theory turns your musical feelings into words that anyone can understand.

## Why Learn Music Theory?

### 1. **Reproducibility**
- **Before:** "I just feel it"
- **After:** "Use the Dorian scale over the minor chord, and it creates a mysterious, floating feeling"

### 2. **Development**
- **Before:** Stuck in the same patterns
- **After:** "If I use this scale here, what happens if I try it over a different chord?"

### 3. **Communication**
- **Before:** "Play something that sounds cool"
- **After:** "Try the Mixolydian scale over the dominant chord"

## The Pasta Recipe Analogy

### **Cooking Intuition → Recipe**
- You taste something delicious
- You break down the ingredients and steps
- Anyone can recreate the same taste

### **Musical Intuition → Music Theory**
- You hear something that moves you
- You identify the scales, chords, and progressions
- Anyone can recreate the same feeling

**Start with what moves you, and let the theory follow.**
