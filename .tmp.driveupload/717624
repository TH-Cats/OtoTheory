# What Are Intervals? (Beginner Level)

### Understanding the "distance" between notes makes it easier to recreate and expand musical ideas

> **Interval = the unit that shows the distance between notes.**
> When you think in terms of "how far apart" notes are, ear training, songwriting, and analysis all become clearer.

## 1) Why knowing distances helps

When you learn a melody or riff by ear, you're already sensing the *distance* between notes â€” "a little higher," "a lot lower."
Intervals turn that feeling into **numbers you can understand and reproduce**.

If music theory were a recipe, intervals would be your **tablespoons and teaspoons** â€” a common unit everyone understands.
That shared language lets you **recreate the same flavor** of sound.
In other words, intervals are the **measuring tools** that make music a shared language.

* **Ear training:** You can write down what you hear as steps or jumps.
* **Composition:** Design melodic motion to create specific moods.
* **Analysis:** Describe progressions and melodies in measurable terms.

Understanding intervals builds the **foundation** for learning chords and scales later.

For example, a C major chord is made of Câ€“Eâ€“G, and an E major chord is Eâ€“G#â€“B. Remembering every note of every chord is hard, but in intervals, it's simple:
A **major chord** = **Root + 3rd + 5th**.
Plug in any root (C, F#, etc.), and just move up a 3rd and a 5th â€” that's your chord.

## 2) Câ€“Dâ€“Eâ€“Fâ€“Gâ€“Aâ€“Bâ€“C and the concept of the root

Let's use the C major scale to see how intervals relate to notes:

| Note     | C          | D   | E   | F   | G   | A   | B   | C            |
| -------- | ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------ |
| Interval | 1st (Root) | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th (Octave) |

The key rule: **Count the root note as "1."**
So if C is the root, D is 2nd, E is 3rd, and so on.

### ðŸŽ¶ Where the half steps are

In C major, there are only two places where the interval is a *half step*:

| Between                   | Distance  | Interval relationship |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| 3rd (E) and 4th (F)       | Half step | 3 â†’ 4                 |
| 7th (B) and next root (C) | Half step | 7 â†’ 1 (next octave)   |

All other steps are **whole steps (1 tone)**.
Knowing this pattern lets you understand any key by the *distance* from its root.

### ðŸŽ¸ What happens when you change the root

If you move the root from C to D, all notes shift up by one whole step â€” everything sounds higher, but the *relationships* stay the same.
That's why "Câ€“Dâ€“Eâ€“Fâ€“Gâ€“Aâ€“Bâ€“C" and "Dâ€“Eâ€“F#â€“Gâ€“Aâ€“Bâ€“C#â€“D" sound similar â€” the intervals between notes are identical.

## 3) Half steps and whole steps on the guitar

On the guitar, **moving up one fret = a half step**. Move up **two frets = one whole step (1 tone)** â€” that's a change of **one interval degree**.

Because of this, once you know your **root note** on the fretboard, you can easily *see* where the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and other intervals lie.
That's why the guitar is an instrument where **intervals are visible** â€” theory literally appears under your fingers.

## 4) Summary: Intervals are music's shared unit

* **Intervals = distance between notes.** They're the foundation for ear training, composition, and improvisation.
* Thinking in intervals (instead of note names) helps you recognize the same patterns in any key.
* On the guitar, once you know your root, you can *see* where every interval sits.
* Mastering intervals will make the rest of music theory much easier to understand.
