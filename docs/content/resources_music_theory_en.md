## 1. Notes and Degrees (Reading in Numbers) {#degrees}

> **Key Point**: Use **1 = tonic** to understand **position relationships through numbers 1–7**. When the key changes, "1" moves (movable do). The number sequence stays the same.

### 1.1 What Are Degrees (Movable Do System) {#what-are-degrees}
- C major: **1=C 2=D 3=E 4=F 5=G 6=A 7=B**  
- D major: **1=D 2=E 3=F# 4=G 5=A 6=B 7=C#**  
- **♭/♯ in degrees** (e.g., ♭3, ♯4) indicate "half-step shifts".

**30-Second Recipe**: Say the **1** of your current key out loud, then translate 1→2→3… into note names.

### 1.2 Major vs. Minor Sequences {#major-minor-degrees}
- **Major**: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (whole–whole–half–whole–whole–whole–half)  
- **Natural Minor**: 1 2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 ♭7  
(Harmonic = raised 7, Melodic ascending = raised 6 & 7)

**Example with D as Tonic**  
D major: D E **F#** G A B **C#**  
D natural minor: D E **F** G A **B♭** **C**

**30-Second Recipe**: Identify what degree the melodic peak is, then place that degree as the top note in your accompaniment.

### 1.3 C↔D Conversion Cheat Sheet {#c-d-cheatsheet}
| Degree | C Major | D Major |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | C | D |
| 2 | D | E |
| 3 | E | F# |
| 4 | F | G |
| 5 | G | A |
| 6 | A | B |
| 7 | B | C# |

**30-Second Recipe**: **I–V–vi–IV (C–G–Am–F)** in C → **D–A–Bm–G** in D.

### 1.4 Degrees vs. Intervals {#degree-vs-interval}
- **Degrees**: Numbers within a key (1–7)  
- **Intervals**: Distance between any two notes (perfect 5th, minor 3rd, etc.)  
→ Use **degrees for progressions/melodies, intervals for voicings**.

### 1.5 Finding Degrees on the Fretboard: Quick Method {#on-fretboard}
1. Fix **1 (tonic)** on 6th or 5th string (e.g., D = 5th string 5th fret / 6th string 10th fret).  
2. On the same string: **+2 = 2 → +2 = 3 → +1 = 4 …** (whole–whole–half…).  
3. Work backwards from forms that place the desired degree on **top**.

## 2. Chord Basics (Building by Numbers) {#chords}

### 2.1 Triads {#triads}
- **Major**: 1–3–5 (sunny)  
- **Minor**: 1–♭3–5 (cloudy)  
- **Dim**: 1–♭3–♭5 (anxious)  
- **Aug**: 1–3–♯5 (floating)

**30-Second Recipe**: Play D→**Dm**→G (change just the 3rd by a half-step) to hear the color shift.

### 2.2 Seventh Chords {#sevenths}
- **V7** = arrow pushing to I (A7→D)  
- **maj7** = dissolves into the same place (Dmaj7)  
- **m7** = calm depth (Em7)  
- **m7♭5** = bridge tension (Bø)

**30-Second Recipe**: Play **A→A7→D** to feel the 7th's "arrow effect".

### 2.3 Reading Symbols (add/sus/slash) {#symbols}
- **add9**: Add color  
- **sus4/sus2**: Suspend 3rd temporarily → resolve back to 3  
- **D/F#**: Specify bass note (inversion)

**30-Second Recipe**: Oscillate **D–Dsus4–D** to experience "suspension → resolution".

## 3. Keys and Roman Numerals (Transposing by Numbers) {#key-roman}

### 3.1 Diatonic Chords {#diatonic}
- **D major**: D Em F#m G A Bm C#°  
- **D minor (natural)**: Dm E° F Gm Am (or A) B♭ C

**30-Second Recipe**: Transpose **I–V–vi–IV** to D → **D–A–Bm–G**.

### 3.2 Function and Cadences {#tsd}
- **T (stable)**: I, vi  
- **S (preparation)**: ii, IV  
- **D (gravitational pull)**: V, vii°  

**Cadence Examples**:  
V→I (strong) / IV→I (soft) / V→vi (deceptive)

**30-Second Recipe**: Always use **V→I** at the start of the chorus to plant a flag.

## 4. Guitar-Specific {#guitarist}

### 4.1 Voicing vs. Form {#voicing-vs-form}
**Form** = fingering pattern / **Voicing** = internal arrangement.  
Same D chord sounds different depending on whether the **top note is F# or A**.

**30-Second Recipe**: Keep top notes **A→A→B→B** through D→Bm→G→A.

### 4.2 Inversions and Slash Chords {#inversions}
Use **D/F#** or **A/C#** for smooth bass lines.  
**30-Second Recipe**: D→**A/C#**→Bm→**G/D** (bass moves D→C#→B→D in steps).

### 4.3 Harmonic Rhythm {#harmonic-rhythm}
Design of chord duration. Verse = 1 bar, chorus = 2 beats creates **contrast** for drama.  
**30-Second Recipe**: Switch to **2-beat changes** in the second chorus for acceleration.

---

## 5. Adding Color {#color}

### 5.1 Secondary Dominants (V/○○) {#secondary}
Temporarily treat target chord as tonic → approach with its V7.  
**Example**: In D, **E7→A** (V/V→V).  
**30-Second Recipe**: Insert **E7→A** right before the chorus.

### 5.2 Modal Interchange (Borrowed Chords) {#modal-interchange}
Borrow **bVII / bVI / iv** from parallel minor.  
**Example**: **D–C–G** (I–bVII–IV), **D–Gm–D** (I–iv–I).  
**30-Second Recipe**: Replace interlude with **D–C–G–D**.

### 5.3 Tritone Substitution & Backdoor {#tritone-backdoor}
**A7→D** becomes **E♭7→D**. **G→C7→D** for gentle resolution.  
**30-Second Recipe**: Use **E♭7→D** only at the ending.

### 5.4 Passing Diminished {#diminished}
Insert **#ivo°7** for one beat to create a chromatic bridge.  
**Example**: **D｜G#°7｜A｜D**.  
**30-Second Recipe**: Add **just a moment** of #ivo°7 before the chorus.

## 6. Practical Recipes (By Use Case) {#recipes}

### Singer-Songwriter
- **Foundation**: I–V–vi–IV  
- **Technique**: Verse uses open chords, chorus adds 7ths (A7).  
- **Caution**: Keep low end light, top note close to vocal range.

### Two Guitars
- **Foundation**: One focuses on roots, the other on 3rd/7th.  
- **Technique**: When clashing, remove the 5th.  
- **Caution**: Don't thicken too much in the same register.

### Band (With Bass)
- **Foundation**: Guitar delegates root duty to bass.  
- **Technique**: Stay in upper 3–4 strings with tight voicings.  
- **Caution**: With distortion, reduce 3rds.

## 7. Quick Fixes {#troubleshoot}

**Muddy/Not Cutting Through**: Low-end overlap. → Remove 5th, prioritize **3rd/7th + root**.  
**Chorus Too High**: First **change key (±half-step)**, adjust fingering later.  
**Chord Too Difficult**: Replace with easier chord having **same function** (A7 → C#° / Em/A etc.).

---

## 8. FAQ {#faq}

**Q. If D is "1", what degree is C?**  
A. In both D major and D minor, **C = ♭7**. **C# = 7**.

**Q. What does "♭3" become when the key changes?**  
A. Always "3 lowered a half-step from 1". C = E♭, D = F, E = G.

**Q. What's the difference between degrees and Roman numerals?**  
A. **Degrees = single note numbers**, **Roman numerals = chords built on those numbers**.
