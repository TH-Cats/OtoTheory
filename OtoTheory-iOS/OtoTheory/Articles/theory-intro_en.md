# 🎵 What Is Music Theory?

### Turn your musical instinct into understanding

> "You can make music by instinct. **With theory, you can make it repeatable—and grow it.**"

Starting from **ears and instinct** is perfect.
The moment you want to **bring back the same magic on purpose**, theory helps.
It isn't a rulebook; it's the **words that let your instincts be repeated**.

## 🎙️ Paul's instinct, put into words

> "I don't read music. I just know what sounds right."
> — *Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now*

Even without formal study, songs like "Let It Be" (C–G–Am–F) reveal a balance you can feel:
a **place that feels like home** and a **push that moves you forward**.
They **felt** it. Theory **names** it so **anyone** can do it again.

## 🍝 Think of theory as a simple recipe

It's like this: imagine you want to cook delicious pasta. You might experiment by tasting many versions, wondering how each flavor is made, and finally discover how to cook it your way. But if a **recipe** already exists, you'd probably start by following it—then add garlic, adjust the heat, or change the ingredients to make it your own.

Music theory is exactly that **recipe**.

Music theory works the same way:

* First, you reach the **same result** again (repeatability).
* Then, you **tweak safely**—a little richer, a little lighter (evolution).

Because you can reproduce the base, small changes become **creative, not risky**.

## 🎼 Turning a Beatles song into a "recipe"

Let's analyze **Hey Jude** as if it were a cooking recipe.

* **Key**: F Major

* **Chord progression**: F → C → C7 → F → Bb → F → C (I–V–V7–I–IV–I–V)
   → The tonic (F), subdominant (Bb), and dominant (C) each play a clear role, forming a stable harmonic foundation.
   The appearance of **C7** in the chorus and bridge acts as a kind of *borrowed chord*: its Bb note isn't part of the F major scale, introducing a **Mixolydian flavor** that gives the song its warm, blues‑tinged tone.
   The melody is built on the F major scale but occasionally features the ♭7 (E♭), which adds a **loose, open blues feel**. This sound, especially in the "na‑na‑na" refrain, creates Paul's signature blend of warmth and wistful brightness.

In short:

> **"Start from a classic major scale, season it with a ♭7 for color, and repeat I–V to raise the emotion."**

This simple but expressive "recipe" can help you write songs that capture the same open, heartfelt spirit as *Hey Jude*.

## 🚀 Repeat, then evolve — the real payoff

Rely only on instinct and success can be a **one-off accident**.
Name what worked, and you can **set up the same conditions** next time—
then add **tiny changes** (a touch more harmony, a brief detour, a new texture) with confidence.
That's how a **personal style** emerges.

## ✅ It's okay not to get it yet

OtoTheory is designed so you **see, hear, and try** first; the words click **later**.
Start with your **feelings**, and let the app do the gentle teaching.

* New to harmony? Read **"What Are Chords?"**
* Unsure about key? Try **"What Is a Key?"**
* Not ready for scales? See **"What Are Scales?"** — you'll learn by trying.

> You don't have to read everything in order. Pick what you need, **try it in the app**, and the ideas will stick.
